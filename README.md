# Test deployments

This repository is used to test deployment processes and configurations.
This works with [test-sql-aciton](https://github.com/surasithaof/test-sql-action) to demonstrate deployment scenarios.
When service has new migration file, it will copy and open a PR to the deployment repository for further processing.
